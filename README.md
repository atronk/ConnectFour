# ConnectFour

Connect Four is a two-player connection board game, in which the players take turns to place symbols 'X' or 'O' into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid.
The symbols are put on the grid, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's symbols.
